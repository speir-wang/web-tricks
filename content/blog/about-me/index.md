Front-end developer from Melbourne, working at [BUENO Systems](http://www.buenosystems.com.au/)

We use React for building the UI, Jest and Enzyme to test our product and most importantly, we use Git to do the version control.

Outside the work, I love playing FIFA (even though I still can't beat the WordClass level computer) and MarioKart.

From the profile image, you can tell that I am a Warriors fan as well.
